# mastery

Mastery is a platform for managing an offline employee development program. It handles class management, signups, wait
lists, notifications, attendance and more for in person training.

Mastery is a Ruby on Rails application designed to be deployed locally. Stay tuned for installation scripts and
additional configuration options.

As with any open source project, feel free to fork, pull and file issues :-)
